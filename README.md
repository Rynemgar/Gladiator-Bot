# Gladiator Bot

Gladiator Bot is my first real JS project.
To begin with it will just be a simple fun bot who responds to challenges and taunts to other members.

Once I get further into it, a mini game will form where each challenger will be issued 100 health and a fight will commence.
Players will be able to choose their attacks from Head, Body or Legs.
Challenger attacks first.
*Head = -50hp 20% chance.
*Body = -30hp 50% chance.
*Legs = -10hp 90% chance.

The last person standing, wins.

Again, once I get further into it, an EXP system will be formed for leveling up.
